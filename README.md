# The Blooming Lotus Jukebox

## Project Description

The Blooming Lotus is an interactive kinetic sculpture powered by an ESP32 that mimics the natural blooming and unblooming of a lotus flower. A motor-driven screw mechanism controls the petal motion, synchronized with a vibrant display of 16 NeoPixel LEDs breathing through rainbow colors. As the lotus blooms, the LEDs transition smoothly from red to violet, and reverse as it closes. Additionally, the project functions as a wireless jukebox: users can connect over Wi-Fi to an HTML page and select between Pop, Rap, or EDM playlists stored on an SD card through a DFPlayer Mini module. A 16x2 I2C LCD screen continuously displays “Now Playing…” whenever music is active, making the experience visually and audibly
